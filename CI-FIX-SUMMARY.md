# CI Fix Summary

## Problem
The CI pipeline was failing with the error:
```
ERROR: type "memo_status" already exists (SQLSTATE 42710)
```

This occurred during database migrations when trying to create a custom PostgreSQL ENUM type that already existed in the database. The issue was that our database reset script was only dropping tables but not custom types like ENUMs.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Database Reset Script
Modified `scripts/reset-test-db.sh` to drop all custom types (ENUMs) before dropping tables:

```sql
DO $$
BEGIN
    FOR type_name IN
        SELECT t.typname
        FROM pg_type t
        JOIN pg_catalog.pg_namespace n ON n.oid = t.typnamespace
        WHERE n.nspname = 'public'
        AND t.typtype = 'e'  -- 'e' for enum types
    LOOP
        EXECUTE 'DROP TYPE IF EXISTS ' || type_name || ' CASCADE';
        RAISE NOTICE 'Dropped type: %', type_name;
    END LOOP;
END $$;
```

This SQL query identifies all ENUM types in the public schema and drops them with CASCADE, ensuring that any types used in table definitions are properly removed.

### 2. Added Defensive Migration Approach
Updated the migration file `internal/platform/postgres/migrations/20250415000002_create_memos_table.sql` to use a defensive approach when creating the ENUM type:

```sql
DO $$
BEGIN
    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM pg_type WHERE typname = 'memo_status') THEN
        CREATE TYPE memo_status AS ENUM (
            'pending',
            'processing',
            'completed',
            'completed_with_errors',
            'failed'
        );
    END IF;
END $$;
```

This ensures that the migration will not fail if the type already exists, making our migrations more resilient.

## Testing
The changes were committed and the CI pipeline was triggered again to verify that the fixes resolve the issue. The solution addresses two aspects:

1. **Prevention**: The database reset script now properly cleans up custom types
2. **Resilience**: The migration uses defensive programming to handle edge cases

## Additional Benefits
- Improved resilience of our migration process
- Better cleanup of test databases for more consistent test runs
- Added important diagnostic information (NOTICE messages) when types are dropped

## Next Steps
- Monitor CI runs to confirm the issue is resolved
- Consider applying the defensive pattern to other migrations that create custom types
- Update documentation to highlight the importance of dropping both tables and types during database resets
