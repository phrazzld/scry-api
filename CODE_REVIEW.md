## Detailed Review

### Logic & Correctness

**Strengths:**
- **✅ Accurate simulation:** Correctly simulates a server restart by setting up task state directly in DB, then starting a new application instance
- **✅ Comprehensive scenario coverage:** Tests cover success, failure, and API-triggered cases
- **✅ Proper state verification:** Tests verify both task and memo status transitions directly in the database
- **✅ Thread-safe mocks:** `RecoveryMockGenerator` uses mutex to protect its execution count

**Areas for Improvement:**
- **⚠️ DBTX casting:** Helper functions cast `store.DBTX` to `*sql.Tx`, which tightly couples to SQL implementation
- **⚠️ Magic strings:** "memo_generation" type string could be a defined constant for consistency

### Architecture & Design

**Strengths:**
- **✅ Clean test setup abstraction:** `setupRecoveryTestInstance` creates a consistent test environment
- **✅ Effective mocking:** Tests use mocks for external dependencies (generator, card repository) only
- **✅ Proper dependency injection:** Components receive dependencies through constructors
- **✅ Database isolation:** Tests use `testutils.WithTx` to run in isolated transactions

**Areas for Improvement:**
- **⚠️ Setup function length:** `setupRecoveryTestInstance` is quite long (~80 lines), could be broken down
- **⚠️ Configuration duplication:** Task runner config is duplicated across test cases

### Code Quality

**Strengths:**
- **✅ Clear naming:** Function and variable names are descriptive and follow conventions
- **✅ Organized test structure:** Clear phases (Setup, Recovery, Verification) with comments
- **✅ Effective logging:** Useful logging during test execution
- **✅ Helper function reuse:** Common operations encapsulated in reusable functions

**Areas for Improvement:**
- **⚠️ Potential dead code:** `databaseTask` struct and `NewDatabaseTask` may be unused
- **⚠️ Manual type conversions:** Several places with manual type conversions could be avoided

### Testing

**Strengths:**
- **✅ Smart assertions:** Uses `require` for setup steps and `assert` for outcomes
- **✅ Comprehensive verification:** Tests check status, execution count, and side effects
- **✅ Async handling:** `waitForRecoveryCondition` properly handles async operations
- **✅ Error reporting:** Timeout messages include the last error for easier debugging

**Areas for Improvement:**
- **⚠️ Missing comments:** The purpose of manual status updates in `TestTaskRecovery_API` could use a comment
- **⚠️ Fixed timeouts:** Timeout values might need adjustment for CI environments

## Recommendations

1. **Refactor database helpers** to avoid casting `store.DBTX` to `*sql.Tx` - either enhance the `DBTX` interface or create specific test helpers
2. **Add a constant** for task types instead of using string literals
3. **Extract common configuration** to avoid duplication across test cases
4. **Add clarifying comments** for the manual state manipulation in `TestTaskRecovery_API`
5. **Consider removing** `databaseTask` and `NewDatabaseTask` if unused

## Conclusion

This PR demonstrates high-quality integration testing for a critical recovery mechanism. The tests are thorough, well-structured, and effectively validate the system's ability to recover tasks interrupted during processing. The implementation aligns well with the project's development philosophy, particularly regarding immutability, dependency injection, and explicit error handling. With some minor refactoring, this code will serve as an excellent example of integration testing in the system.
