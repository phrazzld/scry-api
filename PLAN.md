## Detailed Remedies

### cr-01 Remove Mock LLM from Main Application Path
- **Problem:** The application uses mock LLM generator in the main application path, risking deployment with non-functional AI.
- **Impact:** Critical production failure if deployed; core flashcard generation functionality would use test data instead of actual AI-generated content.
- **Chosen Fix:** Use build tags to conditionally compile generator initialization based on the build environment.
- **Steps:**
  1. Create `internal/platform/gemini/generator_prod.go` (no build tag) containing `createGenerator` that returns the real implementation.
  2. Create `internal/platform/gemini/generator_test.go` (with `//go:build test_without_external_deps`) containing a test implementation.
  3. Update `cmd/server/main.go` to call `gemini.createGenerator()` instead of directly initializing a mock.
  4. Ensure CI/CD pipeline doesn't include the test build tag for production builds.
- **Done-When:** Production build uses real LLM; test build uses mock; no direct mock initialization in main.

### cr-02 Replace Panics with Error Returns
- **Problem:** Several constructors panic when provided with nil dependencies instead of returning errors.
- **Impact:** Application crashes during startup with minimal diagnostics if dependencies are misconfigured.
- **Chosen Fix:** Modify constructors to return errors instead of panicking, allowing for graceful handling.
- **Steps:**
  1. Update `NewCardReviewService` and `NewCardHandler` signatures to return `(..., error)`.
  2. Replace panic calls with `return nil, fmt.Errorf("dependency %s cannot be nil", "depName")`.
  3. Update all callers to handle potential errors.
  4. Add error handling in application setup to log detailed diagnostic information.
- **Done-When:** Application handles initialization errors gracefully with clear error messages.

### cr-07 Consolidate Repository Interfaces/Adapters
- **Problem:** Multiple repository interfaces and adapters create confusion and unnecessary abstraction layers.
- **Impact:** Increased complexity, overlapping responsibilities, unclear architectural boundaries.
- **Chosen Fix:** Consolidate repository interfaces by adding key methods to existing store interfaces.
- **Steps:**
  1. Add `GetForUpdate` method to `store.UserCardStatsStore` interface.
  2. Ensure Postgres implementation properly implements the new method.
  3. Remove separate repository adapters in the card_review package.
  4. Update `CardReviewService` to use the store interfaces directly.
  5. Update main.go to remove adapter creation and inject store implementations directly.
- **Done-When:** No separate repository interfaces exist; services use store interfaces directly.

### cr-08 Use Centralized Mock in Card Handler Tests
- **Problem:** Tests define local mock implementations instead of using the centralized mocks.
- **Impact:** Duplication of mock logic, inconsistent test behavior, maintenance burden.
- **Chosen Fix:** Replace local mocks with centralized mocks from the mocks package.
- **Steps:**
  1. Remove the local `mockCardReviewService` from `api/card_handler_test.go`.
  2. Import and use `mocks.MockCardReviewService` with functional options.
  3. Update assertions to use the standard mock's tracking capabilities.
- **Done-When:** All tests use centralized mocks consistently.

### cr-03,04,05,06 Refactor Card Review API Tests
- **Problem:** API tests are verbose with duplicate setup, manual validation, and complex assertions.
- **Impact:** Tests are difficult to maintain, understand, and extend.
- **Chosen Fix:** Leverage testutils helpers to simplify test code and improve maintainability.
- **Steps:**
  1. Replace manual server/router setup with `testutils.SetupCardReviewTestServer`.
  2. Replace manual HTTP request execution with helper methods like `ExecuteGetNextCardRequest`.
  3. Replace manual response validation with `AssertCardResponse` and similar helpers.
  4. Simplify service call count assertions.
- **Done-When:** Tests are significantly more concise, use consistent patterns, and remain comprehensive.

### cr-09 Add Deterministic DB Ordering
- **Problem:** The GetNextReviewCard SQL query relies on implicit ordering when timestamps match.
- **Impact:** Non-deterministic behavior in tests and production when cards have identical due times.
- **Chosen Fix:** Add a secondary sort key to ensure consistent ordering.
- **Steps:**
  1. Modify the ORDER BY clause to `ORDER BY ucs.next_review_at ASC, c.id ASC`.
  2. Add a comment explaining the reason for the secondary sort key.
  3. Create or update tests to verify deterministic ordering.
- **Done-When:** Query includes secondary sort key; tests confirm deterministic ordering.

### cr-18 Consolidate Duplicate Test Helper
- **Problem:** The `createCardWithStats` helper function is duplicated across test files.
- **Impact:** Violates DRY principle, potential for inconsistencies if logic needs updates.
- **Chosen Fix:** Move the helper to the testutils package.
- **Steps:**
  1. Create `CreateTestCardWithStats` in `internal/testutils/domain_helpers.go`.
  2. Remove duplicate implementations.
  3. Update test files to use the centralized helper.
- **Done-When:** No duplicate helper implementations exist; tests use the centralized helper.

### cr-14, cr-15 Improve API Error Response Security
- **Problem:** API handlers expose raw internal data and validation errors in responses.
- **Impact:** Information leakage useful to attackers; poor user experience.
- **Chosen Fix:** Return standardized, user-friendly error messages instead of raw errors.
- **Steps:**
  1. Update `cardToResponse` to handle unmarshal errors safely (return nil or generic error structure).
  2. Modify validation error handling to return user-friendly messages without internal details.
  3. Update tests to verify the improved error responses.
- **Done-When:** API responses contain user-friendly errors without exposing internal details.

### cr-17 Move Adapter Creation
- **Problem:** Repository adapters are created within router setup rather than during application initialization.
- **Impact:** Obscures dependency graph, violates dependency injection principles.
- **Chosen Fix:** Move adapter creation to application initialization (or remove adapters entirely if cr-07 is implemented).
- **Steps:**
  1. If adapters are still needed after cr-07, move their creation to startServer.
  2. Update setupRouter to accept fully constructed dependencies.
- **Done-When:** Clear dependency graph with adapters created during application initialization.

### cr-10, cr-11, cr-12 Harden Pre-commit Hook Environment
- **Problem:** Pre-commit hooks rely on user shell profiles and use hardcoded paths.
- **Impact:** Brittle development environment setup, inconsistent behavior across systems.
- **Chosen Fix:** Make hook scripts more self-contained and portable.
- **Steps:**
  1. Remove shell profile sourcing from run_glance.sh.
  2. Use mktemp for temporary files instead of hardcoded paths.
  3. Define minimal PATH setup within the script.
  4. Test the hook in different environments.
- **Done-When:** Hooks run consistently across different environments without user-specific configuration.

### cr-16 Remove Unused Import Workaround
- **Problem:** A variable is defined solely to suppress an "imported and not used" error.
- **Impact:** Code clarity issue, obscures the actual reason for the import.
- **Chosen Fix:** Remove the unnecessary workaround.
- **Steps:**
  1. Remove `sqlRef := sql.IsolationLevel(0)` and related code.
  2. Verify code compiles correctly.
- **Done-When:** Workaround is removed; code compiles without warnings.

## Standards Alignment
- **Simplicity First:** Consolidating repository interfaces (cr-07) and removing unnecessary code (cr-16) directly improve simplicity. Refactoring tests (cr-03-06) makes them easier to understand and maintain.
- **Modularity:** Fixing mock LLM usage (cr-01) enforces architectural boundaries. Moving adapter creation (cr-17) improves dependency injection clarity.
- **Design for Testability:** Comprehensive test improvements (cr-03-06, cr-08, cr-18) enable easier testing and maintenance. Using build tags for LLM initialization (cr-01) allows proper testing without affecting production.
- **Error Handling:** Replacing panics with errors (cr-02) and improving API error responses (cr-14, cr-15) align with best practices for robust error handling.
- **Security:** Fixing mock LLM usage (cr-01) prevents potential production issues. Improving API error responses (cr-14, cr-15) reduces information leakage.
