# T002 Completion Document

## Task Summary
- **Task ID:** T002
- **Title:** Delete mock-based API test files
- **Context:** cr-01 Remove Contradictory Mock-Based API Tests (Steps 2-3)
- **Priority:** P1

## Actions Taken
1. Deleted `cmd/server/auth_api_test.go` - Removed mock-based API test file for auth endpoints
2. Deleted `cmd/server/card_api_test.go` - Removed mock-based API test file for card endpoints
3. Fixed build tag in `cmd/server/postpone_card_api_test.go` to use compatibility layer correctly:
   - Added `compatibility` build tag
   - Updated functions to use directly from the `api` package instead of relying on the compatibility functions
4. Verified the code compiles and passes linting
5. Marked T002 as completed in TODO.md

## Verification
1. Verified that the files were successfully deleted
2. Confirmed that the codebase builds successfully with `go build ./cmd/server`
3. Verified that the codebase passes linting with `golangci-lint run`
4. Confirmed that the integration tests can be built (though not run due to database dependencies)

## Discussion
The task involved removing mock-based API test files that were superseded by integration tests using real dependencies. By removing these files, we've eliminated redundancy and potential contradictions in test coverage.

The postpone_card_api_test.go file required minor updates to properly use the compatibility layer, ensuring smooth transition to the new test structure.

## Next Steps
The next logical step is to proceed with T003, which involves auditing integration test coverage gaps that might have been created by the deletion of these mock-based tests.
