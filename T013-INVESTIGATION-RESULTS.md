# T013: Investigation of Unused Code - Results

## Summary
I have investigated the usages of `databaseTask` struct and `NewDatabaseTask` function in the codebase to determine if they are used anywhere.

## `databaseTask` Findings

1. There are **two** different `databaseTask` implementations in the codebase:
   - In `/cmd/server/main_recovery_test.go` (lines 401-410): This is a test-specific implementation
   - In `/internal/platform/postgres/task_store.go` (lines 210-246): This is the actual production implementation used by the task store

2. The test-specific implementation in `main_recovery_test.go` appears to be completely unused:
   - It's declared and defined within the test file
   - No instances of calling `NewDatabaseTask` or creating instances of this struct were found in any test file
   - All the integration tests are using alternative task implementations (`MockTask`, `customTestTask`)

3. The production implementation in `task_store.go` is actively used:
   - It's created in the `getTasksByStatus` method (line 187) when retrieving tasks from the database
   - This is the concrete implementation of the `Task` interface used when loading stored tasks

## `NewDatabaseTask` Findings

1. The function `NewDatabaseTask` in `main_recovery_test.go` (lines 380-399) is completely unused:
   - It's defined in the test file but never called
   - No references to it exist in any test file or production code
   - It creates an instance of the test-specific `databaseTask` struct

## Conclusion

Based on the investigation:

1. The test-specific `databaseTask` struct and `NewDatabaseTask` function in `main_recovery_test.go` are completely unused and can be safely removed.

2. The production `databaseTask` struct in `task_store.go` is actively used and should be retained.

## Evidence

1. No direct calls to `NewDatabaseTask` were found in the codebase
2. No direct instantiations of the test-specific `databaseTask` struct were found
3. All test files use alternative task implementations for testing (`MockTask`, `customTestTask`)
4. The tests that deal with task recovery and lifecycle do not use the test-specific `databaseTask`

This conclusively determines that the test-specific implementation is unused and can be safely removed.
