# T013 Completion: Add Comprehensive Table-Driven Tests for SQL Redaction

## Task Description
Add comprehensive table-driven tests for SQL redaction in `internal/redact/redact_test.go` to cover various SQL statements with embedded sensitive data in different clauses, validating the effectiveness and precision of the chosen redaction method (T012).

## Implementation Approach
I implemented a comprehensive set of table-driven tests for the SQL redaction functionality in `internal/redact/redact_test.go`. The implementation follows these key principles:

1. **Enhanced Test Structure**: Moved from direct assertion of expected strings to a more flexible approach that checks:
   - Absence of sensitive data (using `notExpect` list)
   - Presence of expected redaction patterns (using `contains` list)

2. **Test Coverage Categories**:
   - Basic SQL statement types (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
   - Sensitive data types in SQL (UUIDs, emails, passwords, numeric IDs, dates, JSON, etc.)
   - SQL syntax variations (quotes, JOINs, functions, subqueries, etc.)
   - Edge cases (long queries, capitalization, whitespace, etc.)
   - PostgreSQL-specific features (dollar-quoted strings, array operations, JSONB operators)

3. **Test Function Organization**:
   - `TestSQLRedaction`: Focused specifically on SQL redaction patterns with 40+ test cases
   - `TestCombinedRedactionPatterns`: Tests how SQL redaction interacts with other redaction patterns
   - `TestRedactionPerformance`: Verifies efficient handling of large SQL statements

## Integration Test Failures
The tests in the `internal/api` package are currently failing because they expect the old SQL redaction pattern (`[REDACTED_SQL]`), while our enhanced implementation uses more specific patterns (`SELECT FROM... [SQL_VALUES_REDACTED]`, etc.). These tests need to be updated to match the new redaction patterns.

Specific failures:
1. `TestErrorRedactionWithHandleAPIError/SQL_query`: Expects SQL to be completely redacted, but our implementation preserves the SQL command structure
2. `TestErrorRedactionWithLiveHandlerScenarios/memo_handler_with_SQL_error`: Similar issue with SQL structure preservation
3. `TestErrorRedaction/SQL_error_details`: Looking for older `[REDACTED_SQL]` pattern

## Next Steps
The failures in the `internal/api` package suggest a follow-up task is needed to update the tests to match the new SQL redaction patterns. This is an anticipated issue as mentioned in T012's completion document, given that we adopted the contingency approach that preserves SQL command structure while redacting sensitive values.

## Conclusion
The implementation adds comprehensive table-driven tests for SQL redaction, covering a wide range of SQL statements and data patterns. The tests confirm the effectiveness of the contingency approach implemented in T012, showing that sensitive data is properly redacted while preserving SQL command structure for debugging purposes.
