# T014 · Chore · P1: manually verify SQL redaction effectiveness in logs

## Implementation Approach

1. Created a test script to generate SQL queries with sensitive data
   - Developed a standalone Go program that logs various SQL queries containing sensitive information
   - Covered major SQL operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) with sensitive data in different clauses
   - Included various sensitive data types (UUIDs, emails, passwords, tokens)

2. Executed the test script with debug logging enabled
   - Set logging level to debug to ensure all SQL statements would be captured
   - Captured logs to a file for analysis

3. Analyzed the logs to verify redaction effectiveness
   - Examined both pre-redacted and non-redacted queries
   - Evaluated the preservation of SQL structure and debugging utility
   - Assessed the redaction of sensitive data across different contexts

## Findings

### Redaction Effectiveness

1. **When explicitly applied** using `redact.String()`, the SQL redaction logic is working correctly:
   - SELECT statements are redacted to "SELECT FROM... [SQL_VALUES_REDACTED]"
   - INSERT statements preserve table and column names but redact values
   - UPDATE statements preserve table names but redact set values
   - DELETE statements preserve table names but redact where conditions

2. **The contingency approach** implemented in T012 is effective:
   - SQL structure is preserved for debugging purposes
   - Different SQL operations get appropriate redaction patterns
   - Table names and structure remain visible while sensitive data is redacted

### Integration Gaps

1. **Critical Issue**: Redaction is not automatically applied to:
   - Log fields containing SQL queries
   - Error messages containing SQL queries
   - Standalone sensitive data (UUIDs, emails, passwords, tokens)
   - PostgreSQL error messages that may contain sensitive values

2. **Root Cause**: The redaction logic is not integrated with the logging system
   - The structured JSON logger does not apply redaction to field values before logging
   - Error wrapping does not automatically apply redaction to SQL in error messages

## Recommendations

1. **Logger Integration**: Modify the logger to apply redaction to string values before logging
   - Implement a middleware or wrapper around slog that applies redaction
   - Special handling for error types to use redact.Error()

2. **SQL Error Handling**: Enhance database layer to apply redaction to SQL errors
   - Create wrapper functions for database operations that redact errors
   - Add middleware to redact errors before they're included in responses

3. **Additional Patterns**: Add specific redaction for database error messages
   - PostgreSQL error messages often include the actual values that violated constraints
   - These patterns should be added to the redaction logic

## Verification

The SQL redaction logic itself (as implemented in T012 and tested in T013) is technically sound and effective when explicitly applied. However, its integration with the logging system has significant gaps that need to be addressed to provide comprehensive protection against sensitive data exposure in logs.

This finding is particularly important as it identifies a security vulnerability in the current implementation - sensitive data is still being exposed in logs despite the redaction logic being technically functional.

## Next Steps

A follow-up ticket should be created to address the integration gaps identified in this verification:

**Proposed Ticket**: "Feature · P0: integrate SQL redaction with logging and error handling systems"
