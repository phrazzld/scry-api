# SQL Redaction Analysis

## Test Results

I've analyzed the logs from our SQL redaction test, focusing on how effectively sensitive data is redacted while maintaining sufficient query structure for debugging. Here are my findings:

### 1. SQL Query Redaction

#### Successfully Redacted:
- **Pre-redacted queries** (using `redact.String()` directly) are properly redacted:
  - SELECT queries show only "SELECT FROM... [SQL_VALUES_REDACTED]"
  - INSERT queries show "INSERT INTO users (id, username, email, password) VALUES [SQL_VALUES_REDACTED]"
  - UPDATE queries show "UPDATE users SET [SQL_VALUES_REDACTED]"
  - DELETE queries show "DELETE FROM sessions [SQL_WHERE_REDACTED]"

#### Not Redacted:
- **Direct logging of SQL queries**: When SQL queries are directly included in log messages, they're NOT being redacted:
  - Example: `{"level":"INFO","msg":"SQL Test 1 - Original query","query":"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000' AND email = 'admin@example.com' AND password = 'secret123'"}`
  - All sensitive data (UUIDs, emails, passwords) remain visible

- **SQL queries in error messages**: SQL queries included in error messages are NOT being redacted:
  - Example: `{"level":"ERROR","msg":"SQL Test 1 - Error with query","error":"database error: SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000' AND email = 'admin@example.com' AND password = 'secret123'"}`

### 2. Other Sensitive Data Redaction

- **Standalone sensitive data**: Individual sensitive values aren't being redacted when logged directly:
  - UUIDs: `{"level":"INFO","msg":"Testing query with UUID","uuid":"123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"}`
  - Emails: `{"level":"INFO","msg":"Testing query with email","email":"user@example.com"}`
  - JWT tokens: `{"level":"INFO","msg":"Testing query with JWT token","token":"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ"}`

- **Combined sensitive data**: When multiple sensitive data types appear in a single string, they aren't redacted:
  - Example: `{"level":"INFO","msg":"Testing combined sensitive data","data":"User 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000 (admin@example.com) with API key 'secret123' logged in from 192.168.1.1"}`

- **PostgreSQL error messages**: Sensitive data in error messages isn't redacted:
  - Example: `{"level":"ERROR","msg":"Database operation failed","pg_error":"ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint \"users_email_key\" (SQLSTATE 23505), Key (email)=(user@example.com) already exists"}`

## Analysis

### Redaction Logic Effectiveness
- The `redact.String()` function correctly identifies and redacts SQL queries when used explicitly
- The SQL structure is preserved appropriately (e.g., SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE commands remain visible)
- The implementation successfully uses different redaction patterns for different query types (VALUES vs WHERE)
- Sufficient information is retained for debugging (table names, field names) while sensitive data is removed

### Integration Gap
- **Critical Issue**: The redaction logic isn't being automatically applied to log fields and error messages
- This indicates a gap in integration between the redaction logic and the logging system
- The structured JSON logger doesn't appear to be using the redaction function on field values before logging

### Security Implications
- Sensitive data (including UUIDs, emails, passwords, tokens) is currently exposed in logs
- This creates a security risk, as logs may be accessed by monitoring systems, developers, or administrators
- Error messages containing complete SQL queries with sensitive data could be exposed in application responses

## Recommendations

1. **Integrate redaction with logging system**:
   - Modify the logger to apply `redact.String()` to all string values before logging
   - Specifically handle error values to ensure `redact.Error()` is applied

2. **Enhance error handling**:
   - Ensure all errors containing SQL are passed through `redact.Error()` before being returned
   - Add middleware to redact errors before they're sent in API responses

3. **Additional redaction patterns**:
   - Add specific redaction for PostgreSQL error messages that may contain sensitive data

4. **Testing in production-like environment**:
   - Once fixes are implemented, verify in a staging environment with real database interactions
   - Check logs from normal API operations to ensure all sensitive data is properly redacted
