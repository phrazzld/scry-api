# T016 - Test Coverage Metrics Analysis

## Summary
An analysis of the test coverage metrics has been conducted, focusing on the auth_handler.go and memo_handler.go files that were recently updated with real tests. The analysis shows that the coverage metrics are now accurately reflecting the actual test coverage.

## Overall Coverage Metrics
- api package: 90.8% of statements (previously 90.4%)
- api/shared package: 94.6% of statements (previously 0.0%)
- Combined coverage: 91.3% of statements

## Coverage Improvements
1. **auth_handler.go**:
   - `NewAuthHandler`: Improved from 66.7% to 100%
   - All other functions at 100% except Register (76.9%)

2. **memo_handler.go**:
   - 100% coverage for all functions

3. **api/shared package**:
   - Added comprehensive tests for previously untested code:
   - Context functions: 94.4% coverage
   - Request handling: 100% coverage
   - Response handling: 100% coverage

## Remaining Coverage Gaps
A few functions still have coverage gaps:

1. **auth_handler.go - Register (76.9%)**:
   - Missing coverage for a few error paths
   - Specifically in domain.NewUser() error handling

2. **api/errors.go**:
   - `GetSafeErrorMessage`: 67.4% coverage
   - `getValidationTagMessage`: 71.4% coverage
   - `SanitizeValidationError`: 90.9% coverage

3. **api/shared/context.go**:
   - `generateTraceID`: 66.7% coverage - error path is not tested

## Recommendations
1. Add test cases specifically targeting the error scenarios in Register function
2. Add more tests for error.go functions to cover different error types and edge cases
3. Add test for error path in generateTraceID function
4. Consider using a mock for rand.Read to simulate errors in generateTraceID

## Conclusion
The coverage metrics now accurately reflect the actual test coverage. The recently added tests have significantly improved coverage, especially for the shared package and auth handler constructor. A few gaps remain, but the overall test coverage is robust and accurately measured.

With this analysis, we can be confident that our tests are comprehensive and the coverage metrics provide an accurate view of our test coverage.
