# T029 Progress Report: Build Tag Compatibility

## Completed Work

1. **Root Cause Analysis:**
   - Identified that the CI was failing because `testutils_for_tests.go` used the build tag `test_internal_only`
   - CI was using `test_without_external_deps`, causing test helper functions to be unavailable

2. **Implementation:**
   - Modified `testutils_for_tests.go` to support both build tags with `//go:build test_without_external_deps || test_internal_only`
   - Created task T029 in TODO.md to standardize build tags across the codebase
   - Added detailed audit in `ci-failure-audit.md` documenting the issue
   - Created reference patch in `build-tag-fix.patch` showing how to fix pre-commit hooks

3. **Results:**
   - Successfully fixed the Lint check in CI which was failing with undefined symbol errors
   - The Build job now passes in CI
   - Most CI checks now pass

## Remaining Issues

While our changes fixed the build tag compatibility issue, there are still some test failures in the CI pipeline:

1. **SQL Redaction Tests:**
   - Tests in the API package fail with SQL redaction errors
   - The tests expect SQL queries to be fully redacted with `[REDACTED_SQL]` but they're not
   - These failures are unrelated to our build tag fixes

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Task T029:**
   - Implement the pre-commit hook configuration change in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
   - Audit all build tags across test files for consistency
   - Standardize on either `test_without_external_deps` or include both tags

2. **Address SQL Redaction Test Failures:**
   - Create a new task to fix the SQL redaction in error logs
   - Update the redaction logic to fully remove SQL queries from error logs

These steps will ensure both local development and CI testing work correctly with consistent build tags across the codebase.
