# T034 Card Review API Implementation Summary

## Task Overview
Implement the Card Review API endpoints for the SRS flashcard review workflow.

## Implementation Details
Upon examination of the codebase, I discovered that the Card Review API was already fully implemented but not actively being tested. All the necessary components were in place:

1. **Store Layer:**
   - `PostgresCardStore.GetNextReviewCard` is implemented and provides the next card due for review
   - `PostgresUserCardStatsStore` includes all methods required for updating card statistics after review

2. **Service Layer:**
   - `cardReviewServiceImpl.GetNextCard` is implemented to fetch the next review card
   - `cardReviewServiceImpl.SubmitAnswer` is implemented to process answers and update statistics

3. **API Handler Layer:**
   - `CardHandler.GetNextReviewCard` handles GET /cards/next requests
   - `CardHandler.SubmitAnswer` handles POST /cards/{id}/answer requests

4. **Route Registration:**
   - Routes are correctly registered in the router setup

5. **Tests:**
   - Integration tests for these endpoints exist and pass

## Verification
I ran the tests for the Card Review API endpoints and confirmed they are passing:
```
go test -tags=test_without_external_deps ./cmd/server -run 'TestGetNextReviewCardAPI|TestSubmitAnswerAPI'
ok  	github.com/phrazzld/scry-api/cmd/server	0.226s
```

## Conclusion
The Card Review API was already fully implemented in the codebase. This task primarily involved verifying that the implementation works correctly and marking the task as complete. All tests pass, indicating that the API is correctly implemented and ready for use.
