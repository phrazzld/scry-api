# ruthless task‑planning prompt

## Task Description
Implement `store.MemoStore` and `store.CardStore` interfaces and Postgres implementations for Memo/Card/Stats persistence and status updates. This is the first step in the larger "Memo & Card Generation Implementation" epic, providing the data access layer needed for storing memos, generated flashcards, and tracking their states.

you are the senior architect in charge of writing the **single source‑of‑truth plan** for the scoped task. your mission: design the cleanest, most maintainable implementation path possible—rooted in our **development_philosophy.md**—and expose every technical decision, risk, and trade‑off in writing. no timelines, no stakeholder fluff, just hard engineering detail.

## 1 collect context
- read the task description + any linked specs.
- internalize every relevant rule in **development_philosophy.md** (simplicity, modularity, separation, testability, coding standards, security, docs, logging).

## 2 draft candidate approaches
for each **distinct** technical approach you can justify:

1. **summary** – one‑sentence gist.
2. **step list** – numbered build steps (5‑15 bullets max).
3. **alignment analysis** – how it fares against *each* philosophy section (call out wins + violations).
4. **pros / cons** – focus on maintainability, testability, extensibility, performance, complexity.
5. **risks & mitigations** – tag every risk `critical / high / medium / low`.

> if two approaches are 90 % identical, collapse them.

## 3 pick the winner
choose the approach that best satisfies the philosophy hierarchy:

1. simplicity
2. modularity + strict separation
3. testability (minimal mocking)
4. coding standards
5. documentation approach

justify selection in ≤ 5 bullet points, citing explicit trade‑offs.

## 4 expand into the definitive plan
produce a **plan.md** containing these sections:

```
# plan title (task name)

## chosen approach (one‑liner)

## architecture blueprint
- **modules / packages**
  - name → single responsibility
- **public interfaces / contracts**
  - signature sketches or type aliases
- **data flow diagram** (ascii or mermaid)
- **error & edge‑case strategy**

## detailed build steps
1. step
2. step
…
n. step
(precise enough to turn straight into a todo list)

## testing strategy
- test layers (unit / integration / e2e)
- what to mock (only true externals!) and why
- coverage targets & edge‑case notes

## logging & observability
- log events + structured fields per action
- correlation id propagation

## security & config
- input validation hotspots
- secrets handling
- least‑privilege notes

## documentation
- code self‑doc patterns
- any required readme or openapi updates

## risk matrix

| risk | severity | mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| …    | critical | …          |
| …    | medium   | …          |

## open questions
- itemize anything blocking execution
```

## 5 output requirements
- return **only** the finished `plan.md` content—no extra chatter.
- ensure every claim traces back to a philosophy rule or an engineering rationale.
- brutality over politeness: call out weak spots loudly.
