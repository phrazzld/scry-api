# Task: Implement Authentication API Endpoints and Middleware

## Description
We need to implement two authentication endpoints: Registration (`POST /auth/register`) and Login (`POST /auth/login`), as well as the JWT authentication middleware for protected routes. These endpoints and middleware will leverage the existing User Store and JWT Authentication Service implementations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Implement `POST /auth/register` endpoint that validates input and creates user accounts
- Implement `POST /auth/login` endpoint that authenticates users and returns JWT tokens
- Implement JWT authentication middleware for protecting API routes
- Integrate middleware with the router
- Add comprehensive validation for all request payloads
- Return proper HTTP status codes and error messages
- Add thorough integration tests for authentication flows
- Ensure all error scenarios are properly handled and tested

## Dependencies
- User Store implementation (completed)
- JWT Authentication Service (completed)

# Implementation Approach Analysis Instructions

You are a Senior AI Software Engineer/Architect. Your goal is to analyze a given task, generate potential implementation approaches, critically evaluate them against project standards (especially testability), and recommend the best approach, documenting the decision rationale.

## Instructions

1. **Generate Approaches:** Propose 2-3 distinct, viable technical implementation approaches for the task.

2. **Analyze Approaches:** For each approach:
   * Outline the main steps.
   * List pros and cons.
   * **Critically Evaluate Against Standards:** Explicitly state how well the approach aligns with **each** standard document (`CORE_PRINCIPLES.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_GUIDELINES.md`, `CODING_STANDARDS.md`, `TESTING_STRATEGY.md`, `DOCUMENTATION_APPROACH.md`). Highlight any conflicts or trade-offs. Pay special attention to testability (`TESTING_STRATEGY.md`) â€“ does it allow simple testing with minimal mocking?

3. **Recommend Best Approach:** Select the approach that best aligns with the project's standards hierarchy:
   * 1. Simplicity/Clarity (`CORE_PRINCIPLES.md`)
   * 2. Separation of Concerns (`ARCHITECTURE_GUIDELINES.md`)
   * 3. Testability (Minimal Mocking) (`TESTING_STRATEGY.md`)
   * 4. Coding Conventions (`CODING_STANDARDS.md`)
   * 5. Documentability (`DOCUMENTATION_APPROACH.md`)

4. **Justify Recommendation:** Provide explicit reasoning for your choice, detailing how it excels according to the standards hierarchy and explaining any accepted trade-offs.

## Output

Provide a Markdown document containing:
* A section for each proposed approach, including steps, pros/cons, and the detailed evaluation against **all** standards.
* A final section recommending the best approach with clear justification based on the standards hierarchy. This output will inform the implementation plan.
