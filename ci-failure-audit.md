# CI Failure Audit

## Overview
The CI for PR #26 (branch: feature/card-management-api) is currently failing due to test failures. Some CI checks have passed while others are pending or failing.

## Passing Checks
- Vulnerability Scanner
- Dependency Review
- Build
- Lint

## Failing Checks
- Test

## Pending Checks
- CodeQL SAST Scan

## Skipped Checks
- Test Gemini Integration

## Detailed Analysis
The test failure appears to be due to the overall test suite failing, even though all individual tests that ran seemed to pass or be skipped. There were several tests skipped with messages like:

```
Skipping integration test - requires DATABASE_URL environment variable
```

This suggests that the integration tests are being skipped due to missing database configuration, which might be expected in the CI environment.

However, despite all the visible tests passing or being skipped correctly, the test command still exited with code 1, indicating a failure.

## Possible Causes
1. There might be a mismatch between the deleted and modified service test files shown in the git status:
   - Deleted: `internal/service/card_service_test.go`
   - Added: `internal/service/mocks_test.go`
   - Added: `internal/service/store_mock_test.go`
   - Added: `internal/service/unit_test.go`

2. The test output shows some tests are being skipped because they require a DATABASE_URL environment variable, which may not be set in the CI environment. This is likely intentional.

3. There could be a test that's not properly skipped or fails silently.

## Recommendations
1. **Examine Recent Changes**: Review the changes made to test files in the most recent commits, particularly focusing on the service tests that were deleted and added.

2. **Check CI Configuration**: Ensure that the CI is properly configured for testing, including any necessary environment variables or test flags.

3. **Run Tests Locally**: Run the tests locally with the same command used in CI to see if you can reproduce the failure.

4. **Add Verbose Output**: Modify the CI configuration to run tests with the `-v` flag to get more detailed output that might pinpoint the failing test(s).

5. **Fix Code Issues**: Based on the git status, there seems to be work in progress related to card service tests. Ensure that all test dependencies are properly addressed when refactoring this code.
