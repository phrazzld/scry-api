# CI Failure Audit

## Overview

The CI for PR #26 "feat: implement card management API endpoints" has failed. This document analyzes the failure and recommends fixes.

## Failure Details

The CI pipeline failed in the "Test" job, while all other jobs (Lint, Build, Security Checks) succeeded.

### Error Summary

The test failure is related to the `TestPostponeCardEndpoint` test in the `postpone_card_api_test.go` file. The error occurs because the test is trying to connect to a PostgreSQL database, but no database is available in the CI environment:

```
TestPostponeCardEndpoint
postpone_card_api_test.go:25: Database ping failed: failed to connect to `user=postgres database=scry_test`:
    127.0.0.1:5432 (localhost): dial error: dial tcp 127.0.0.1:5432: connect: connection refused
    [::1]:5432 (localhost): dial error: dial tcp [::1]:5432: connect: connection refused
--- FAIL: TestPostponeCardEndpoint (0.00s)
```

### Analysis

The issue is that while most integration tests properly check for the existence of a database connection and skip the test if no connection is available, the `TestPostponeCardEndpoint` test does not implement this check correctly.

Most integration tests use code similar to this:
```go
if os.Getenv("DATABASE_URL") == "" && os.Getenv("SCRY_TEST_DB_URL") == "" {
    t.Skip("DATABASE_URL or SCRY_TEST_DB_URL not set - skipping integration test")
}
```

However, `TestPostponeCardEndpoint` apparently attempts to connect to the database even when these environment variables are not set, leading to the failure.

## Recommended Fix

The `TestPostponeCardEndpoint` test in `cmd/server/postpone_card_api_test.go` needs to be modified to properly skip the test when no database connection is available.

The fix would be to add the same check at the beginning of the test function:

```go
func TestPostponeCardEndpoint(t *testing.T) {
    // Add this check
    if os.Getenv("DATABASE_URL") == "" && os.Getenv("SCRY_TEST_DB_URL") == "" {
        t.Skip("DATABASE_URL or SCRY_TEST_DB_URL not set - skipping integration test")
    }

    // Rest of the test...
}
```

This will ensure the test is skipped in CI environments where no database is available, consistent with other integration tests in the codebase.

## Additional Notes

1. The test coverage is 82.5%, which is good but could be improved.
2. All other CI checks (Lint, Security Checks, Build) passed successfully.
3. Consider adding a database service container to the CI workflow if integration tests should actually run during CI, rather than being skipped.
