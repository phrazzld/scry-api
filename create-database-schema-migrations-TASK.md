# Create Initial Database Schema Migrations

## Task Description
Implement initial database schema migrations for all domain models (User, Memo, Card, UserCardStats). This includes creating SQL migration files with proper "up" and "down" migrations, ensuring appropriate constraints and indexes, and following PostgreSQL best practices.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create migration files for all required tables using the goose migration format
2. Define `users` table with appropriate fields matching the User domain model
3. Define `memos` table with appropriate fields matching the Memo domain model, including status field
4. Define `cards` table with appropriate fields including JSONB content structure
5. Define `user_card_stats` table with appropriate fields for SRS algorithm
6. Add essential indexes for performance, especially on `next_review_at` field
7. All tables must have proper foreign key constraints
8. Implement complete "down" migrations for rollback scenarios
9. Ensure all migrations follow PostgreSQL best practices
10. Migrations must be reversible (down migration should completely undo up migration)

## Depends On
- Database migration framework implementation ✓
- Core domain models implementation ✓

# EXECUTE

## 1. SELECT AND ASSESS TASK

- **Goal:** Choose and assess the next appropriate task from `TODO.MD`.
- **Actions:**
    - Scan `TODO.MD` for tasks marked `[ ]` (incomplete). Select the first task whose prerequisites (`Depends On:`) are already marked `[x]` (complete) or are 'None'.
    - Record the exact Task Title.
    - Mark the task as in-progress by changing `[ ]` to `[~]` in `TODO.MD`.
    - **Assess Complexity:** Analyze the task requirements, determining if it's:
        - **Simple:** Small change, single file, clear requirements, no architecture changes
        - **Complex:** Multiple files, complex logic, architectural considerations, or any uncertainty
    - **Route Accordingly:**
        - For **Simple** tasks, follow Section 2 (Fast Track)
        - For **Complex** tasks, follow Section 3 (Comprehensive Track)

## 2. FAST TRACK (SIMPLE TASKS)

### 2.1. CREATE MINIMAL PLAN

- **Goal:** Document a straightforward implementation approach.
- **Actions:**
    - **Analyze:** Review the task details from `TODO.MD`.
    - **Document:** Create `<sanitized-task-title>-PLAN.md` with:
        - Task title
        - Brief implementation approach (1-2 sentences)

### 2.2. WRITE MINIMAL TESTS (IF APPLICABLE)

- **Goal:** Define happy path tests only.
- **Actions:**
    - Write minimal tests for the core happy path
    - Skip if task isn't directly testable

### 2.3. IMPLEMENT FUNCTIONALITY

- **Goal:** Write clean, simple code to satisfy requirements.
- **Actions:**
    - Consult project standards documents as needed
    - Implement the functionality directly

### 2.4. FINALIZE & COMMIT

- **Goal:** Ensure work passes checks and is recorded.
- **Actions:**
    - Run checks (linting, tests) and fix any issues
    - Update task status in `TODO.MD` to `[x]` (complete)
    - Commit with conventional commit format

## 3. COMPREHENSIVE TRACK (COMPLEX TASKS)

### 3.1. PREPARE TASK PROMPT

- **Goal:** Create a detailed prompt for implementation planning.
- **Actions:**
    - **Filename:** Sanitize Task Title -> `<sanitized-task-title>-TASK.md`.
    - **Analyze:** Re-read task details (Action, AC Ref, Depends On) from `TODO.MD` and the relevant section in `PLAN.MD`.
    - **Retrieve Base Prompt:** Copy the content from `prompts/execute.md` to use as the base for your task prompt.
    - **Customize Prompt:** Create `<sanitized-task-title>-TASK.md` by adding task-specific details to the base prompt:
        - Add task title, description, and acceptance criteria at the top.
        - Keep all the original instructions from the base prompt.
        - Ensure the prompt maintains the focus on standards alignment.

### 3.2. GENERATE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WITH ARCHITECT

- **Goal:** Use `architect` to generate an implementation plan based on the task prompt and project context.
- **Actions:**
    - **Find Task Context:**
        1. Find the top ten most relevant files for task-specific context
    - **Run Architect:**
        1. Run `architect --instructions <sanitized-task-title>-TASK.md --output-dir architect_output --model gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25 --model gemini-2.0-flash docs/DEVELOPMENT_PHILOSOPHY.md [top-ten-relevant-files]`
        2. After architect finishes, review all files in the architect_output directory (typically gemini-2.5-pro-exp-03-25.md and gemini-2.0-flash.md).
        3. ***Think hard*** about the different model outputs and create a single synthesized file that combines the best elements and insights from all outputs: `<sanitized-task-title>-PLAN.md`
    - If you encounter an error, write it to a persistent logfile and try again.
    - Report success/failure. Stop on unresolvable errors.
    - **Review Plan:** Verify the implementation plan aligns with our standards hierarchy:
        1. Simplicity and clarity over cleverness (`CORE_PRINCIPLES.md`)
        2. Clean separation of concerns (`ARCHITECTURE_GUIDELINES.md`)
        3. Straightforward testability with minimal mocking (`TESTING_STRATEGY.md`)
        4. Adherence to coding conventions (`CODING_STANDARDS.md`)
        5. Support for clear documentation (`DOCUMENTATION_APPROACH.md`)
    - Remove `<sanitized-task-title>-TASK.md`.

### 3.3. WRITE FAILING TESTS

- **Goal:** Define expected behavior via tests, adhering strictly to the testing philosophy.
- **Actions:**
    - **Consult All Standards:** Review task requirements (`AC Ref:`, `<sanitized-task-title>-PLAN.md`) and adhere to all standards, with particular focus on testing:
        - Ensure tests reflect the simplicity principle (`CORE_PRINCIPLES.md`)
        - Test through public interfaces as defined in the architecture (`ARCHITECTURE_GUIDELINES.md`)
        - Follow coding standards in test code too (`CODING_STANDARDS.md`)
        - **Strictly adhere to testing principles, avoiding mocks of internal components** (`TESTING_STRATEGY.md`)
        - Document test rationale where needed (`DOCUMENTATION_APPROACH.md`)
    - **Write Happy Path Tests:** Write the minimum tests needed to verify the core *behavior* for the happy path, focusing on the public interface. **Prioritize tests that avoid mocking internal components.**
    - **Write Critical Edge Case Tests:** Add tests for important error conditions or edge cases identified.
    - **Verify Test Simplicity:** ***Think hard*** - "Are these tests simple? Do they avoid complex setup? Do they rely on mocking internal code? If yes, reconsider the test approach itself."
    - Ensure tests currently fail (as appropriate for TDD/BDD style).
- **Guidance:** Test *behavior*, not implementation. **Aggressively avoid unnecessary mocks.** If mocking seems unavoidable for internal logic, it's a signal to improve the design.

### 3.4. IMPLEMENT FUNCTIONALITY

- **Goal:** Write the minimal code needed to make tests pass (green).
- **Actions:**
    - **Consult Standards:** Review `CONTRIBUTING.MD`, `CODING_STANDARDS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_GUIDELINES.md`, etc.
    - **Write Code:** Implement the functionality based on `<sanitized-task-title>-PLAN.md` that satisfies the failing tests.
    - **Focus on Passing Tests:** Initially implement just enough code to make tests pass, deferring optimization.
    - **Adhere Strictly:** Follow project standards and the chosen plan.
- **Guidance:** Focus on making tests pass first, then improve the implementation in the refactoring phase.

### 3.5. REFACTOR FOR STANDARDS COMPLIANCE

- **Goal:** Improve code quality while maintaining passing tests.
- **Actions:**
    - **Review Code:** Analyze the code files just implemented to ensure they pass tests.
    - **Assess Standards Compliance:** ***Think hard*** and evaluate against all standards:
        - **Core Principles:** "Does this implementation embrace simplicity? Does it have clear responsibilities? Is it explicit rather than implicit?" (`CORE_PRINCIPLES.md`)
        - **Architecture:** "Is there clean separation between core logic and infrastructure? Are dependencies pointing inward?" (`ARCHITECTURE_GUIDELINES.md`)
        - **Code Quality:** "Does it follow our coding conventions? Does it leverage types effectively? Does it prefer immutability?" (`CODING_STANDARDS.md`)
        - **Testability:** "Can this code be tested simply? Does it require complex setup or extensive mocking of internal components?" (`TESTING_STRATEGY.md`)
        - **Documentation:** "Are design decisions clear? Would comments explain the 'why' not just the 'what'?" (`DOCUMENTATION_APPROACH.md`)
    - **Identify Refactors:** If any standard is not met, identify the **minimal necessary refactoring** to address the issues:
        - For simplicity issues: Extract responsibilities, reduce complexity
        - For architectural issues: Improve separation of concerns, realign dependencies
        - For code quality issues: Apply coding conventions, use types more effectively
        - For testability issues: Reduce coupling, extract pure functions, improve interfaces
        - For documentation issues: Clarify design decisions with appropriate comments
    - **Perform Refactor:** Apply the identified refactoring changes while ensuring tests continue to pass.

### 3.6. VERIFY ALL TESTS PASS

- **Goal:** Ensure all tests pass with the refactored implementation.
- **Actions:**
    - Run the code and all tests.
    - Verify that all tests pass, including the original failing tests and any additional tests added.
    - If any tests fail after refactoring, fix the implementation while maintaining standards compliance.
    - **Do NOT modify tests to make them pass unless the test itself was fundamentally flawed.**

### 3.7. FINALIZE & COMMIT

- **Goal:** Ensure work is complete, passes all checks, and is recorded.
- **Actions:**
    - **Run Checks & Fix:** Execute linting, building, and the **full test suite**. Fix *any* code issues causing failures.
    - **Update Task Status:** Change the task status in `TODO.MD` from `[~]` (in progress) to `[x]` (complete).
    - **Remove Task-Specific Reference Files:** Delete <sanitized-task-title>-PLAN.md
    - **Add, Commit, and Push Changes**
