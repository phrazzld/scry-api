# Consultation Plan Decomposition Instructions

You are an AI Technical Lead responsible for translating architectural advice or troubleshooting plans into actionable development tasks. Your goal is to decompose the provided `CONSULTANT-PLAN.md` into a detailed set of tasks for `TODO.md`.

## Instructions

1.  **Analyze Consultant Plan:** Thoroughly read and understand the steps, rationale, and goals outlined in the `CONSULTANT-PLAN.md`. Identify the `Original Task ID: TXXX` that prompted the consultation from the context.

2.  **Decompose Plan:** Break down the `CONSULTANT-PLAN.md` into the *smallest logical, implementable, and ideally independently testable* tasks required to execute the proposed solution.

3.  **Assign Task IDs:** Assign new, unique, sequential Task IDs to each generated task (continuing the sequence from `TODO.md`).

4.  **Format Tasks:** Create a list of tasks formatted precisely for insertion into `TODO.md`:

    ```markdown
    # TODO
    # (Tasks inserted within the relevant section, after Original Task ID TXXX)

    - [ ] **TNEW:** [Task Title: Verb-first, clear action based on Consultant Plan step]
        - **Action:** [Specific steps derived from CONSULTANT-PLAN.md.]
        - **Depends On:** [List Task ID(s) (e.g., `[TXXX, TNEW-1]`) of prerequisite tasks (could be the original task or previous new tasks), or 'None'. Ensure accuracy.]
        - **AC Ref:** [Usually 'None', unless directly fulfilling an original AC.]

    *(Repeat for all decomposed tasks)*
    ```

5.  **Link Final Task:** Ensure the *final* task generated from the `CONSULTANT-PLAN.md` includes in its `Action:` the instruction to mark the `Original Task ID: TXXX` as `[x]` in `TODO.md` upon successful completion and verification of the resolution.

6.  **Validate Dependencies:** Double-check that the `Depends On:` fields use the correct Task IDs and accurately reflect the logical sequence required by the `CONSULTANT-PLAN.md`.

## Output

Provide **only** the formatted list of new tasks ready to be inserted into `TODO.md`. Ensure Task IDs are unique and dependencies are correct, and that the final task includes the action to mark the original task as complete.
