# Task: Provision Database Infrastructure

## Task Description

Provision and configure a PostgreSQL database infrastructure on DigitalOcean for the Scry API project. This infrastructure will serve as the persistent data store for the application, supporting the core domain models (User, Memo, Card, UserCardStats) and their relationships.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A DigitalOcean Managed PostgreSQL instance is provisioned with appropriate sizing for the application's expected load.
2. PostgreSQL settings are optimized for performance (CPU, RAM, connection limits, work_mem, shared_buffers, etc.).
3. The `pgvector` extension is enabled on the database instance to support future vector operations.
4. Backup processes are configured with appropriate frequency and retention periods.
5. Monitoring is set up for key database metrics with appropriate alerting thresholds.
6. Database access and credentials are configured securely following the principle of least privilege.
7. Connection parameters and access procedures are thoroughly documented for both development and production environments.
8. Local development database setup instructions are provided to mirror the production configuration.
9. Database migrations from the existing codebase are verified to run successfully on the provisioned instance.

## Dependencies

- Completed database schema migrations from previous tasks.
- Access to DigitalOcean account with permissions to create managed database resources.

# Implementation Approach Analysis Instructions

You are a Senior AI Software Engineer/Architect. Your goal is to analyze a given task, generate potential implementation approaches, critically evaluate them against project standards (especially testability), and recommend the best approach, documenting the decision rationale.

## Instructions

1. **Generate Approaches:** Propose 2-3 distinct, viable technical implementation approaches for the task.

2. **Analyze Approaches:** For each approach:
   * Outline the main steps.
   * List pros and cons.
   * **Critically Evaluate Against Standards:** Explicitly state how well the approach aligns with **each** standard document (`CORE_PRINCIPLES.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_GUIDELINES.md`, `CODING_STANDARDS.md`, `TESTING_STRATEGY.md`, `DOCUMENTATION_APPROACH.md`). Highlight any conflicts or trade-offs. Pay special attention to testability (`TESTING_STRATEGY.md`) â€“ does it allow simple testing with minimal mocking?

3. **Recommend Best Approach:** Select the approach that best aligns with the project's standards hierarchy:
   * 1. Simplicity/Clarity (`CORE_PRINCIPLES.md`)
   * 2. Separation of Concerns (`ARCHITECTURE_GUIDELINES.md`)
   * 3. Testability (Minimal Mocking) (`TESTING_STRATEGY.md`)
   * 4. Coding Conventions (`CODING_STANDARDS.md`)
   * 5. Documentability (`DOCUMENTATION_APPROACH.md`)

4. **Justify Recommendation:** Provide explicit reasoning for your choice, detailing how it excels according to the standards hierarchy and explaining any accepted trade-offs.

## Output

Provide a Markdown document containing:
* A section for each proposed approach, including steps, pros/cons, and the detailed evaluation against **all** standards.
* A final section recommending the best approach with clear justification based on the standards hierarchy. This output will inform the implementation plan.
