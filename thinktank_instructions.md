# CI Test Failure Investigation

We're encountering an issue with our Go project's CI pipeline. The build is failing in the "Test" job despite our recent fix where we properly added skip logic to a test that was previously failing due to missing database connection.

## Current Situation

1. We fixed a failing test (`TestPostponeCardEndpoint`) by adding proper database connection checking and skip logic.
2. The test now skips correctly when no database is available (verified in logs).
3. All tests in the CI pipeline are now either passing or properly skipping.
4. However, the test job still fails with exit code 1.

## Questions

1. Why might the Go test command be returning a non-zero exit code despite all tests passing or being skipped?
2. What's the most appropriate way to fix this issue:
   a. Adding a database service to the CI workflow?
   b. Modifying how tests are run or how the CI interprets test results?
   c. Some other approach?
3. Are there any Go-specific testing quirks or configurations that could be causing this issue?

## Relevant Information

- The project is a Go API for spaced repetition flashcards
- We're using GitHub Actions for CI
- The tests are run with: `go test -v -race -coverprofile=coverage.out -tags=test_without_external_deps ./...`
- All integration tests are properly being skipped when database connections aren't available
