# T104: Dependency Information Update Note

## Outcome
After attempting to run `go mod tidy` on the project, we discovered a fundamental issue with the dependency on `google.golang.org/api/ai/generativelanguage/v1beta`, which appears to no longer be available in recent versions of the Google API packages.

## Key Findings
1. The current implementation uses `google.golang.org/api/ai/generativelanguage/v1beta`, but this package path doesn't seem to exist in recent versions of `google.golang.org/api`.

2. Google has migrated their Gemini API implementations to two newer packages:
   - `cloud.google.com/go/ai/generativelanguage/apiv1` for a more integrated Cloud SDK experience
   - `google.golang.org/genai` as a more specialized SDK for generative AI specifically

3. Several attempts to find a version of `google.golang.org/api` that contains the `ai/generativelanguage/v1beta` package were unsuccessful.

## Recommendation
The proper fix would be to update the implementation in `internal/platform/gemini/gemini_generator.go` to use one of the newer recommended packages. Based on Google's own documentation, the preferred path forward would be:

1. Use `google.golang.org/genai` for a simplified Gemini-specific experience, or
2. Use `cloud.google.com/go/ai/generativelanguage/apiv1` for a more Cloud-integrated approach

This refactoring would require changes to the client creation and API call implementations, which is beyond the scope of the current task. I've added the modern packages to the go.mod file, but the implementation will need to be updated in a future task.
